This project involves developing a Salary Prediction System using Simple Linear Regression to estimate salaries based on years of experience. 

The dataset is preprocessed, and a regression model is trained using scikit-learn. 

The model is then deployed using Flask, allowing users to enter their name, company, and experience to receive a salary prediction. 

The web interface is designed with HTML, CSS, and Flask, ensuring a professional and user-friendly experience.

The final model is serialized using joblib, enabling efficient loading and prediction.
